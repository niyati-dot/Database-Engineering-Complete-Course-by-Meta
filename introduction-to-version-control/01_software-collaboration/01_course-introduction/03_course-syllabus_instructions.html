   </p>
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Module 4: Graded Assessment
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  In the final module, you'll learn about the graded assessment. After you complete the individual units in this module, you'll synthesize the skills you gained from the course to manage a project on GitHub.
