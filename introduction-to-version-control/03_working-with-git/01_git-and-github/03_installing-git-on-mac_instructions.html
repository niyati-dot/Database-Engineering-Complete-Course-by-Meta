  Git works on all operating system platforms such as Windows, Mac, and Linux. On Mac or Linux, in some cases, it is installed by default. The majority of users will use Git via the command line as its syntax is very easy to understand and follow. Git also works well in development environments and integrates into IDEs and other GUI offerings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Macs tend to have git installed by default, so before diving into the installation we can run a git version command to check if git is already installed. If the command returns a git version, then git is already installed. If it returns "command not found", git needs to be installed.
