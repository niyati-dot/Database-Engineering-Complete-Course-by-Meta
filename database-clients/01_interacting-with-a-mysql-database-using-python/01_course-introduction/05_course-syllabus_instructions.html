  Module 1
 </h2>
 <p>
  In the first module, you'll receive an introduction to interacting with a MySQL database using Python. You'll discover what a database client is and how they're used in Meta.
 </p>
 <p>
  The second lesson of this module focuses on how to establish a MySQL/Python connection. You'll learn how to install and set up the Jupyter notebook and related Python libraries. You'll then connect to a MySQL database using a Python client. Once you've established a connection, you'll learn how to create a table structure on your MySQL database using Python.
 </p>
 <p>
  The final lesson in this module is about cursors. You'll explore how to work with cursors and MySQL, review different cursor subclasses and demonstrate your new skills in a lab environment.
 </p>
 <p>
  By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Make a connection to a MySQL database using Python
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Create and define databases using Python
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    and process return sets with cursors
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 </p>
 <h2 level="2" variant="h2semibold">
  Module 2
 </h2>
 <p>
  The second module in this course teaches you how to perform queries in MySQL using Python.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the first lesson, you'll explore how to perform create, read, update and delete (or CRUD) operations in a MySQL database using Python.
 </p>
 <p>
  You'll first learn how to create and read records in a MySQL database with Python using the SELECT statements that you covered in previous courses. You'll then learn how to make use of UPDATE and DELETE statements in Python.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the second lesson you'll discover how to perform more advanced queries in  a MySQL database using Python. Examples of these more advanced queries include filtering and sorting data and performing JOIN operations.
 </p>
 <p>
  By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Select data from a MySQL database using Python,
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Edit MySQL records using Python,
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    and retrieve filtered and sorted data from a MySQL database using Python.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 </p>
 <h2 level="2" variant="h2semibold">
  Module 3
 </h2>
 <p>
  In the third module you'll learn about advanced database clients.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first lesson focuses on implementing MySQL functions using Python. You'll review examples of MySQL functions from earlier courses, and then discover how to implement these using Python.
 </p>
 <p>
  You'll also explore different kinds of datetime functions that can be used to query date and time data in a MySQL database.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the second lesson of this module you'll look at some examples of stored procedures that you should already be familiar with from other courses. You'll find out how to create these stored procedures in Python and execute them on a MySQL database.
 </p>
 <p>
  In both of these lessons, you'll demonstrate your new skills by implementing MySQL functions and stored procedures using Python in a lab environment.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the final lesson of this module, you'll explore the topic of connection pools. You'll develop an understanding of the concept of database connection pooling, and how it works. You'll then review the Python/MySQL Connection Pool.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this lesson's lab, you'll work directly with connection pools.
 </p>
 <p>
  By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Access and use MySQL functions with Python,
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Access and use stored procedures with Python,
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    and explain how connection pools work.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>

  Module 4
 </h2>
 <p>
  In the last module, you'll have an opportunity to recap what you learned, identify your strengths and target topics that you would like to revisit in this course. You'll also test your new skills in a lab environment and demonstrate your knowledge by undertaking a graded assessment.
 </p>
 <p>
  By the end of this module you'll be able to:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Synthesize the skills you learned in this course to create a stored procedure for an example project
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    And reflect on the next steps in your learning journey.
