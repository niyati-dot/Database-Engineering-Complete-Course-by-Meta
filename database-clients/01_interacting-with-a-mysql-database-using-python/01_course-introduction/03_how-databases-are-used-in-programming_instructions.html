  <strong>
   Database administrator
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p variant="body1">
  A database administrator is the gatekeeper of the data. They design approaches for optimizing the reading and writing of information. As a troubleshooter this role involves working with the various departments within an organization.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  A knowledge of SQL is a huge asset for administrators because it allows them to make queries regardless of the underlying database engine selected.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  This role requires experience of having worked on some entry level posts like data analyst or programmer. One useful feature of the SQL syntax is that once you can write SQL statements in one engine, you can write them in any engine.
 </p>

  <strong>
   Database modeler
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p variant="body1">
  The role of the database modeler is to set out the schema for the database. They are tasked with maintaining the documentation on the architecture of the database as well as the information solutions that are employed. A good modeler is familiar with database data types, where to use appropriate types of data and how to normalize the tables for good subsequent queries and joins.

  <strong>
   Database engineer
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p variant="body1">
  A database engineer works on the backend and is tasked with creating and populating databases. A good programmer uses functions and procedures. They also often have an additional language with which they can use to interface with the database such as Python or R. This is because data does not come in a vacuum. Information has an origin spot, like a website, and a destination such as an online storage location.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  As a database programmer your job is to write code that seamlessly queries and updates this data as efficiently as possible. An engineer can also act as a data analyst. Database engineer can also be a specialist role.

  <strong>
   Database analyst
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p variant="body1">
  It is the role of the analyst to make business use of the information found in a database. To make sense of the data requires a working knowledge of how to query different tables efficiently and return the data in a way that can easily be processed in a follow-on operation.

 <h2 level="2" variant="h2semibold">
  <strong>
   Database tester
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p variant="body1">
  A database tester is tasked with finding the bugs in the system. This is a specialized role that calls for creative thinking in finding flaws that the system may have. This role requires someone who is independent and content to work outside of a team.

   Conclusion
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p variant="body1">
  There are many roles that can arise from a good grounding in databases. Just as there are many types of information and ways of storing them. There are also many types of personalities that will find a niche for themselves, whether it be a more solitary role of administrator or tester to a more group-centric role of database engineer. There is a place to suit a wide range of different mindsets.
