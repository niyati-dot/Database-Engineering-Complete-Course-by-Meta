  Imagine you are trying to come up with a name for your new dog. You're really unsure of what you'd like to call the dog, so you decide to use your Python skills to help you decide.
 </p>
 <p>
  You start by accessing a file with a shortlist of names you'd like to use for your new pet.
 </p>
 <p>
  The file is named petnames.txt, and has the following content:
 </p>
 <pre language="plain_text">Ace
Atlas
Bailey
Bear
Blaze
Boomer
Buddy
Coco
Cooper
Duke
Dozer
Echo
Gizmo
Harley
Mac
Max
Milo
Oscar
Rex
Rocky
Rocket
Wolfie</pre>
 <p>
  Now that you have the file
  <var>
   petnames.txt
  </var>
  , you'd like to use this file inside your Python program to randomly pick a single pet name.
 </p>
 <p>
  To do this, you'll need to have a Python file into which you'll be importing the
  <var>
   petnames.txt
  </var>
  file, as follows:
 </p>
 <p>
  <var>
   f = open("petnames.txt", "r")
  </var>
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <var>
   open()
  </var>
  function reads in a file outside of the program itself.
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <var>
   open()
  </var>
  function accepts two parameters:
 </p>
 <ol bullettype="numbers">
  <li>
   <p>
    The path and the filename in the form of a string.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    The import mode (the default being
    <var>
     "r"
    </var>
    - which means "read")
   </p>
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  In the line above, I am importing the file at the root of the project. I am only specifying the filename, without the path. I I am also using the default
  <var>
   "r"
  </var>
  mode to read in the file. I am saving the imported file into a variable named
  <var>
   f
  </var>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Next, I'm going to add another variable,
  <var>
   f_content
  </var>
  , and I'm assigning to it the result of reading the
  <var>
   f
  </var>
  file.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the third line, I'm printing the
  <var>
   f_content
  </var>
  variable.
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <var>
   print(f_content)
  </var>
  line returns the exact content of the file, as is:
 </p>
 <pre language="plain_text">Ace
Atlas
Bailey
Bear
Blaze
Boomer
Buddy
Coco
Cooper
Duke
Dozer
Echo
Gizmo
Harley
Mac
Max
Milo
Oscar
Rex
Rocky
Rocket
Wolfie</pre>
 <p>
  Now that I've confirmed that I'm successfully reading in the file, it would not be useful to keep printing out the file's contents, so I can comment out the
  <var>
   print(f_content)
  </var>
  line.
 </p>
 <p>
  Additionally, I can get the
  <var>
   f_content
  </var>
  variable into a list. The string
  <var>
   "\n"
  </var>
  is used to split the text where a new line is found.
 </p>
 <p>
  <var>
   f_content_list = f_content.split("\n")
  </var>
 </p>
 <p>
  Now I'm ready to print the
  <var>
   f_content_list
  </var>
  variable, as follows:
 </p>
 <p>
  <var>
   print(f_content_list)
  </var>
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, the output is as follows:
 </p>
 <pre language="plain_text">['Ace', 'Atlas', 'Bailey', 'Bear', 'Blaze', 'Boomer', 'Buddy', 'Coco', 'Cooper', 'Duke', 'Dozer', 'Echo', 'Gizmo', 'Harley', 'Mac', 'Max', 'Milo', 'Oscar', 'Rex', 'Rocky', 'Rocket', 'Wolfie']</pre>
 <p>
  Here's my complete code up to this point, with the redundant
  <var>
   print()
  </var>
  calls deleted.
 </p>
 <pre evaluatorid="MIvmSTZpRGGL5kk2aURh1w" language="python">f = open("petnames.txt", "r")
f_content = f.read()
f_content_list = f_content.split("\n")</pre>
 <p>
  Now that I have all my potential pet names in a list, I can randomly pick a name from the
  <var>
   f_content_list
  </var>
  of names.
 </p>
 <p>
  To do this, I'll need to import the random module at the top of my code:
  <var>
   import random
  </var>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Now I can use the random module's
  <var>
   choice()
  </var>
  function:
  <var>
   random.choice()
  </var>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <var>
   choice()
  </var>
  function accepts a sequence parameter. A list is one of its accepted values. This means that I can now add another line of code at the very bottom of my program:
 </p>
 <p>
  <var>
   print(random.choice(f_content_list))
  </var>
 </p>
 <p>
  Running the code now will output a random pet name. The first time I ran it, I got the name "Milo", and the second time I ran it, I got the name "Dozer". It's always good to double-check your programs like this by running them multiple times as a quick way to confirm that they behave as intended.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here's the full code of my program now (including the commented-out lines of code):
 </p>
 <pre evaluatorid="4J5tYvoVTlaebWL6FS5Wkw" language="python">import random
f = open("petnames.txt", "r")
f_content = f.read()
f_content_list = f_content.split("\n")
print(random.choice(f_content_list))</pre>
 <p>
  Finally, If I had multiple files in my folder, I could allow myself to pick a file from which to read in a list of names.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here's how that would work:
 </p>
 <pre evaluatorid="NbwENhf6SCO8BDYX-pgjMg" language="python">import random
f_name = input('Type the file name: ')
f = open(f_name) # "r" omitted as it's the default
f_content = f.read()
f_content_list = f_content.split("\n")
print(random.choice(f_content_list))</pre>
 <p>
  The only difference between this improvement and the previous program is that now I'm saving the
  <var>
   f_name
  </var>
  variable as the result of user-provided input. Once I have the
  <var>
   f_name
  </var>
  variable, I'm running the
  <var>
   open()
  </var>
  function on it and then proceeding with other steps as already explained.
