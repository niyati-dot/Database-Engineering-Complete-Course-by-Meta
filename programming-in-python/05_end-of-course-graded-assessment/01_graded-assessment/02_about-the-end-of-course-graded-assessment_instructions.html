  The purpose of the graded assessment
 </h3>
 <p>
  The main purpose of a graded assessment is to check your understanding of the key learning objectives of the course you have just completed. Most importantly, graded assessments help you establish which topics you have mastered and which topics require further focus, before you can complete the course. Ultimately, the graded assessment is designed to help you make sure that you are ready for the next course in this program.
  <strong>
   Prepare for the graded assessment
  </strong>
  You have encountered exercises, knowledge checks, in-video questions and other assessments as you have progressed through the course.
  <strong>
  </strong>
  Nothing in the graded assessment will be outside what you have covered already, so you should be well placed to succeed.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Review the graded assessment
  </strong>
  Please review the feedback after taking the assessment and where necessary go back and work through the topics that you feel require your further attention.
 </p>
 <p>
  Good luck!
