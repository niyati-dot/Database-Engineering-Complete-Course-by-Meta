In the next course, you will learn the primary goals and major benefits of version control. You'll also discover how Meta engineers collaborate on real-life projects and learn how to work with a history of code revisions and experience how developers use version control to resolve conflicts. Finally, you will explore the concept of software collaboration with a focus on version control using GitHub where you will create a repository with forking.
