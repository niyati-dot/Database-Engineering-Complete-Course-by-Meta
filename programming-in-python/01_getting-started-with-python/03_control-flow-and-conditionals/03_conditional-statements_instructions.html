  This reading introduces you to the conditional statements of
  <var>
   if
  </var>
  ,
  <var>
   else
  </var>
  and
  <var>
   elif
  </var>
  .

 <p>
  In keeping with the light switch example, the state of the switch can be stored with a Boolean value of
  <var>
   True
  </var>
  or
  <var>
   False
  </var>
  .
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    On = True
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Off = False
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <pre evaluatorid="C8GuUkQrTVCBrlJEK81QXA" language="python">
#Light is currently off
current = False

if current:
    current = False
    print('Turning light off')

if not current:
    current = True
    print('Turning light on')

</pre>
 <p>
  The code snippet above has a variable called
  <var>
   current
  </var>
  which keeps track of the state of the light - on or off. The first
  <var>
   if
  </var>
  statement will check if the light is on and if it is, the flow will go inside the condition and set the
  <var>
   current
  </var>
  variable to
  <var>
   False
  </var>
  - turning the light off. In the above code snippet, the value of the
  <var>
   current
  </var>
  variable is initially set to
  <var>
   False
  </var>
  , so this condition is not met.
 </p>
 <p>
  The second
  <var>
   if
  </var>
  statement will check if the light is off and if it is, the flow will go inside the condition and will set the
  <var>
   current
  </var>
  varaible to
  <var>
   True
  </var>
  - turning the light on.
 </p>
 <h2 level="2" variant="h2semibold">
  If else
 </h2>
 <p>
  The above code works fine but it can be rewritten more effectively by using another condition called
  <var>
   else
  </var>
  . The following code is an example:
 </p>
 <pre evaluatorid="jqjYNQIrTUuo2DUCK51LCQ" language="python">current = False

if current:
    current = False
    print('Turning light off')
else: 
    current = True
    print('Turning light on')
</pre>
 <p>
  The
  <var>
   else
  </var>
  statement has made your code a bit easier to read and given that the flow relates to the same condition, it makes more sense to combine them as part of a single unit.
 </p>
 <h2 level="2" variant="h2semibold">
  elif
 </h2>
 <p>
  Python also has another condition called
  <var>
   elif
  </var>
  which helps when you have multiple conditions to satisfy. The light switch example is pretty straightforward in that you only have to check for the state of on or off -
  <var>
   True
  </var>
  or
  <var>
   False
  </var>
  . In certain conditions, it may not be that easy. Thankfully
  <var>
   elif
  </var>
  is here to help.

 <p>
  Let's say you want to give a certain discount to customers if they spend over $100. You will also provide an extra discount if that customer is part of a loyalty program. If the customer is not part of the loyalty program and did not spend over a $100, a service charge of 5% is applied.
 </p>
 <pre evaluatorid="_fJetVI8TyiyXrVSPL8oRw" language="python">loyalty_customer = True
total_bill = 124

if loyalty_customer and total_bill &gt; 100:
    #give 20% discount
    total_bill = total_bill - (float(total_bill)/ 100) * 20
elif total_bill &gt; 100:
    #give 10% discount
    total_bill = total_bill - (float(total_bill)/ 100) * 10
else:
    #sorry no discount, 5% service charge applied.
    print('Sorry, no discount ...')

print('Total Bill: ', float(total_bill))</pre>
 <p>
  The above code snippet first checks to see if the customer is part of the loyalty program and if they are spending over $100. If both conditions are met, a discount of 20% is applied to the bill. The
  <var>
   elif
  </var>
  statement will only be executed if the first
  <var>
   if
  </var>
  condition is not met. The
  <var>
   elif
  </var>
  statement will only check if the bill is over $100 and if it is, it will apply a discount of 10%  to the bill.
 </p>
 <p>
  The final
  <var>
   else
  </var>
  statement is only executed if neither of the other two conditions are met. In this case, a charge of 5% is applied to the bill.
