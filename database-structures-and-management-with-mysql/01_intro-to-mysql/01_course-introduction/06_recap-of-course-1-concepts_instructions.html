  Let's take a moment to recap the key concepts that you learned about in the Introduction to Databases course.
 </p>
 <h2 level="2" variant="h2semibold">
  <strong>
   Introduction to SQL
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p>
  You began with an introduction to the course. You explored possible career roles that you can follow as a database engineer. You then received an introduction to SQL, or Standard Query Language and the coding syntax used to interact with databases. Next, you explored the basic structure of databases and learned about the different types of keys they use.​
 </p>
 <h2 level="2" variant="h2semibold">
  <strong>
   SQL data types
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p>
  You then explored SQL data types and learned to differentiate between numeric data, string data and default values. ​You also completed several exercises in which you learned how to utilize these different data types in your database projects.​
 </p>
 <h2 level="2" variant="h2semibold">
  <strong>
   Create, Read, Update and Delete operations
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p>
  You then explored CRUD, or Create, Read, Update and Delete operations.​ You learned how to create databases and tables and populate them with data.​ You studied how to update and delete data.​ And you demonstrated your ability with CRUD operations by completing exercises in which you created and managed data.​
 </p>
 <h2 level="2" variant="h2semibold">
  <strong>
   SQL operators
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p>
  Next, you reviewed SQL operators and learned how to sort and filter data.​ You received a lesson on SQL operators in which you explored the syntax and process steps to deploy SQL arithmetic and comparison operators within a database.
 </p>
 <h2 level="2" variant="h2semibold">
  <strong>
   Sort and filter data using clauses
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p>
  You then learned how to sort and filter data using clauses. The clauses you learned about included ORDER BY, WHERE and SELECT DISTINT. You got an overview of how each clause is used to sort and filter data in a database. You watched several demonstrations of these clauses and had an opportunity to try them for yourself.​
 </p>
 <h2 level="2" variant="h2semibold">
  <strong>
   Database and relational database design
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p>
  You also learned about database design, which included an overview of how to design a database schema. You explored basic database design concepts like schema and learned about different types of schemas.​
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition, you focused on relational database design. You investigated how to establish relationships between tables in a database using keys. You also learned about the types of keys used in relational database design, such as primary, secondary, candidate and foreign keys.​
 </p>
 <h2 level="2" variant="h2semibold">
  <strong>
   Database normalization
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p>
  Finally, you covered the concept of database normalization. In this lesson, you investigated the critical concepts around database normalization, which included the idea of "normal form," including first, second, and third normal forms.​
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that you've recapped what you've learned in the previous course, it's time to start with Database Structures and Management with MySQL!
