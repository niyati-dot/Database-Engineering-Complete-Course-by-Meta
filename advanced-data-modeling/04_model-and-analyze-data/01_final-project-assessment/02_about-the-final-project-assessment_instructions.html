   The purpose of the final project assessment
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p>
  The main purpose of a graded assessment is to check your knowledge and understanding of the key learning objectives of the course you have just completed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most importantly, graded assessments help you to establish which topics you have mastered and which topics require further focus before you can complete the course.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ultimately, this assessment is designed to help you make sure that you’re ready for the next course in this program.
