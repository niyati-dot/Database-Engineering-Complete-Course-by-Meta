   Overview
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p variant="body1">
  Organizations collect lots of data and store it in different kinds of databases. This data represents an important asset that can be used to examine business activities and performance. However, to gain the most benefit from this data, you need to treat it well so that it can be converted into a valuable resource.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  Similarly, data can be accessed, extracted, refined and analyzed to find relationship between existing data to create insights that help the decision makers to plan their business activities, improve their services, reduce costs, minimize risks and increase revenues.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  Data analytics does not stop at analyzing data to describe it (like how many customers placed orders, or the total sales values). This is just the first phase in data analytics. Data analytics processes data to evaluate future probabilities, identify problems, assess risks and predict future opportunities.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  To carry out proper data analytics, you must perform different types of data analysis to identify models, patterns, paradigms and trends. This then helps you to gain an in-depth understanding of the business performance and to predict the future outcomes of  business activities. You might even get recommendations for best plans and courses of action.

   Benefits of data analytics in business
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p variant="body1">
  Over the past decade, data analytics has played a major role in determining how organizations assess risks and seek opportunities. Large corporations and organizations such as Amazon, Microsoft and Apple have invested billions of dollars in advanced data analytics.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  It is important to realize that the ways in which data analytics can be utilized relies on many factors such as the requirements of the business, market conditions, competitors and the domain. Nevertheless, there are generic benefits that can be gained from data analytics regardless of the business size and type.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  For example, data analytics can be used to:

 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p variant="body1">
    Provide refined, detailed and reliable insights that enhance day-to-day business decision making.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p variant="body1">
    Identify and exploit potential opportunities.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p variant="body1">
    Discover ways to monetize data.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p variant="body1">
    Identify threats such as security gaps and breaches.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p variant="body1">
    Predict and proactively respond to changes and challenges in the market.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p variant="body1">
    Obtain a panoramic view of the business activities and operations.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p variant="body1">
    Prevent fraud.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p variant="body1">
    And reveal new areas in which you can reduce business expenses or cost and increase profits.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p variant="body1">
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  It’s also important to remember that nowadays your business is part of the Big Data environment.  This is an environment which includes massive amounts of data, and many kinds of complex data, including structured, semi structured and unstructured data sets. This data comes from a wide variety of data sources such as OLTP databases, commercial data, browsing histories, search engines and social media sites.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  For example, there are more than 500 terabytes of data generated every day by Facebook posts including images, comments and videos. Similarly, there are over 20 petabytes of data generated by Google processes every day across its massive computing clusters. These statistics highlight the importance of using artificial intelligence, machine learning and data mining to help businesses make data-informed decisions.

  <strong>
   Data analytics techniques
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p variant="body1">
  There are many techniques that can be used in data analytics to maximize the value of data insights. Some commonly used techniques with relevant examples are listed below.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
 </p>
 <h3 level="3" variant="h3bold">
  <strong>
   Classification technique
  </strong>
 </h3>
 <p variant="body1">
  The classification technique assigns data items into categories or classes, which allows you to predict the target class of your data. For example, banks use this technique to identify loan applicants with low, medium, or high credit risks based on their historical credit ratings, employment history, property ownership and so on.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
 </p>
 <h3 level="3" variant="h3bold">
  <strong>
   Association rule
  </strong>
 </h3>
 <p variant="body1">
  The association rule identifies the relationships between data elements to determine whether there is a correlation between data. A classic example of the association rule is identifying the relationship between two products in a store. For example, many customers who go to the store to buy a specific product might buy another related product. So, the data shows that there’s a relationship between these two products. This association might be based on data that shows 70% of the total number of the store’s transactions include both products. This data indicates that there is an association link between the two products.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
 </p>
 <h3 level="3" variant="h3bold">
  <strong>
   Outlier detection
  </strong>
 </h3>
 <p variant="body1">
  Outlier detection is used to uncover unusual data within a data set. A common example in this analytics model is credit card fraud detection. This technique can be used to check whether the incoming transaction fits with the customer’s profile and behavior. If a request doesn’t fit a customer’s legacy profile and behavior, then it is flagged as an outlier or anomaly detection.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
 </p>
 <h3 level="3" variant="h3bold">
  <strong>
   Clustering analysis
  </strong>
 </h3>
 <p variant="body1">
  Clustering analysis looks for similarities within a set of data. If it finds similarities, then it separates related data into clusters of subsets based on their common characteristics.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  A good example of clustering analysis is online streaming services. These services use clustering analysis to identify and classify viewers engaged in similar types of streaming activity. The streaming services look at the amount of time a user spent watching videos, and the number of sessions they engaged in per day, week and month.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  These metrics can be used within a cluster analysis to identify client habits. The services then know which demographics they should target with their advertisements and the best ways in which to reach them.
